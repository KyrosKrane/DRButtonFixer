# DRButtonFixer
DragonRiding Button Fixer - a WoW addon to enable mouse buttons for dragon riding

This is a very simple addon that binds the three main dragonriding abilities to your mouse, but only when you're flying on a dragonriding mount. When you stop flying or dismount, the buttons go back to the original binds that you have set.

* Button 3 (center mouse button or wheel): Whirling Surge
* Button 4 (back button by your thumb): Skyward Ascent
* Button 5 (front button by your thumb): Surge Forward

The dragonriding abilities are referenced by name, so this addon may not work if your client is not English based.

There's no setup or configuration, just install and go!
